# Text Summarization Using Seq2Seq Model

NLP Text summarization project using Sequence to Sequence Modelling with LSTMS 

Text summarization is a process of condensing a long text into a concise summary while preserving its essential information. One of the most effective deep learning approaches for text summarization is the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model.

Overview of Seq2Seq Model

The Seq2Seq model is a neural network architecture designed for sequence-based tasks like machine translation and text summarization. It consists of two main components:

1. Encoder

The encoder takes the input text and processes it into a fixed-length context vector.

It is typically implemented using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).

The final hidden state of the encoder captures the meaning of the input sequence and is passed to the decoder.

2. Decoder

The decoder generates the output sequence (summary) step by step based on the encoded context vector.

It predicts one word/token at a time until it generates the final summary.

The decoder is also implemented using RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs.

Working of Seq2Seq in Text Summarization

Input Processing: The input text is tokenized and passed to the encoder.

Encoding: The encoder converts the input into a context vector.

Decoding: The decoder generates the summary one word at a time.

Final Output: The final generated sequence is the summarized version of the input text.

Enhancements in Seq2Seq Models

Attention Mechanism: Helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input text dynamically, improving summary quality.

Transformer-based Models: More advanced architectures like BART, T5, and Pegasus improve summarization accuracy and efficiency.
